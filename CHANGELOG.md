## [1.0.0] â€“ 2025-04-09
### Implemented
- Clipboard copy buttons added beside **Allowed** and **Blocked** region outputs
- Support for GamesPlanet modal-based region restriction lightboxes (`#modal_regionlocks_details`) when applicable
- Output display migrated to standalone `output.html` to separate UI from scan logic
- Removed scan button from output screen to eliminate UX confusion
- Parsing logic enhanced to correctly distinguish phrases such as:
  - *Will activate in...*
  - *Will NOT activate in...*
  - *Can only be activated in...* (and similar variants)
- Added `country-helper.js`: a modular mapping of country names and variations (e.g., "Curacao" vs. "CuraÃ§ao")
- Filtering integrated using `steamgifts-region-filter.js` to exclude unsupported ISO codes on SteamGifts

### Fixed
- Removed dependency on `clipboardWrite` by using the modern `navigator.clipboard` API
- Resolved Firefox CSP violations by removing inline `<script>` logic and isolating behavior to `output-handler.js`
- Enhanced fallback parsing for GamesPlanet's non-standard region strings
- Added `parseCountriesPreservingCommas()` to safely match countries while preserving comma-containing names (e.g., "Congo, Democratic Republic of")
