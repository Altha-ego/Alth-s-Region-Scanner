# ✅ TODO – Alth’s Region Scanner

This file tracks outstanding tasks, features, bugs, and enhancements under consideration for future versions of the extension.

---

## 🐞 Bugs to Fix

### 1. Humble Bundle – Region Scope Detection
- Some gift links show "This key is **not available** in the countries listed below."
- Others show "This key is **only available** in the countries listed below."
- 🔧 Script needs to detect the phrasing and reverse the logic accordingly
- Status: ⏳ Pending

---

## ✨ Feature Ideas & Enhancements

### 1. Support for Additional Stores
- Other steam key stores that display regional restriction information freely
- May require new parsing logic for region restrictions

### 🧠 2. Manual Override UI (Advanced Users) - Contemplation Idea
- Allow user to edit filtered output before copying

### 3. Error Handling / Scan Failure Feedback
- Display clearer messages when region data cannot be found

### 4. Persistent Settings Panel
- Let users toggle preferences like:
  - Auto-scan on page load
  - Highlight store region boxes

### 5. Store-specific Scan Tuning
- Handle unique phrasing/HTML across stores more robustly (e.g. Humble wording)
